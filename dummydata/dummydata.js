        title: 'Fighting Winter\'s Cold Chill with February\'s Hot Newsletter',
        date: '02/20/2019',
        intro: 'It’s easy to feel jilted in February because it’s both the shortest month and has Valentine’s Day’s ubiquitous reminders. But have no fear friends — we here at Pantheon won’t let you down. We knew we had to ramp up our efforts this month to help keep hearts and minds aglow. And so we came through like a bouquet of roses and a box of chocolates, unleashing three of our most prominent Pantheon team members: Creative Director Chris “Joppa” Perkins, Producer Ben Dean, and Executive Producer Brad McQuaid.',
        underwraps: 'Greetings once again Pantheon fans; welcome to the next edition of Under Wraps. So what happened in January? Lead Animator Ross Armstrong has a good start on the upcoming new animations. As discussed last month, we have a lot to do, so seeing the giant strides he’s taking is nothing short of inspiring. Can’t show you these just yet, but we’re thrilled for when we can. The rest of the art team has been active, too. Project Faerthale is busy, visually speaking. So even though we’ve roughly blocked out the zone for pre-alpha builds, we have a lot of refinement happening. You can see in some of the concepts here how Faerthale is really taking on a life of its own, popping with color and detail. Every week, it seems, the Creative department creates something amazing. It doesn’t end with Creative, though. Programming is working extremely hard as well. Part of the planning for Project Faerthale involves addressing a lot of nagging issues — stuff that needed attention for a while but hadn’t been scheduled for fixing until now. Shader refactoring, upgrading to the latest version of Unity, fixing up tool functions all require attention. If not careful, these things can get away from you, so we dedicated time to finish them at the beginning of Project Faerthale. And, if you haven’t heard yet, the tech team is hiring, so things are happening there, too. As of now the job postings are still up, but I happen to know they won’t be for much longer. So if you’ve been waiting to apply, we urge you to wait no longer. This newsletter is packed with more information, so don\'t let my ramblings stop you. Until next time, Ben Dean Producer, Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen',
        qaTitle: 'Q & A with Brad McQuaid',
        qaContent: 'Q: You’ve been developing games for decades now. What drives your passion to continue making games and why MMORPGs specifically? A: Having dabbled with other genres, working on them just doesn’t make me happy. I enjoy playing many types of games, but when it comes to MMOs I have the chance to be part of something epic. We are creating a home as much as a game — how many people can say that? Also there is a “Grand Vision” for the game that goes far beyond Pantheon’s launch. There are so many mechanics, systems, and ideas to try out but don’t necessarily make sense to until post-launch. In the past I’ve not been able to stay on these projects as long as I would have liked, but I’m all-in on Pantheon; here for the long haul and having a blast!',

        communitySpotlightContent: '1) What is your main character\'s in-game name and how did you come up with it? A) My forum name is Dorotea, a name I have often used as a character name in multiplayer games. One of my favorite fantasy series is the Black Company series by Glen Cook and at the end of one of the major books it turns out that the birth name of the leading villain/hero (yes she is both) is Dorotea Senjak.',
        fieldTitle: 'Behind the Design: Atmospheres & Artifacts',
        fieldContent: 'By Chris \'Joppa\' Perkins, 02.20.19 One of my favorite things about Pantheon is the story behind the formation of Terminus, specifically the mysterious “collisions” that have made Terminus what it is today. These dramatic events brought fragments of new worlds to Terminus, allowing a wildly diverse and imaginative landscape. But what has been particularly fun to consider are the metaphysical implications. When a fragment of an alien realm collides with Terminus, what energies and power might it bring? And how would those mystical energies manifest in a new environment? What reactions might we see when the ancient energies of Terminus suddenly mingle with unknown power? These musings have given rise to our Atmosphere System.',

        date: '01/16/2019',
        intro: 'It’s customary at this time of year to look back over the past 12 months in reflection, and look forward to the coming year with anticipation. For many people, the new year is a time to make resolutions on things they wish to improve upon. We here at Visionary Realms are no different, as we continually set goals, adjust our timelines, make improvements and index our progress. ',
        underwraps: 'We are back from the holidays! The time off was nice to rest up and catch up with friends and loved ones but it also provided time to reflect on how far we’ve come in 2018. And looking back, the year was packed. We kicked off 2018 by winning Most Wanted MMO from MMORPG.com for the second year in a row. We are humbled by your votes, have heard your wishes and thoughts and strive to deliver the best Pantheon it can be - the world needs this game.',
        qaTitle: 'Q & A with Ross Armstrong',
        qaContent: 'Q: Welcome to the team, Ross! Can you explain a bit about what your role will be on Pantheon? A: Thanks, it\'s great to be here! I\'m the Lead Animator on Pantheon and my role will change as we get further into production. Initially I\'ll be working closely with the Creative Director, Game Designers and Engineers to understand our quality objectives, gameplay intentions and define the appropriate animation style. Much of this initial work will be blocking out animations and working with Chris Perkins and Designers to understand the timing requirements that best suit the flow of our gameplay, abilities and so on. Since the "Animation Department" is new I\'ll be working with the Engineers and Tech Artists to refine the existing animation pipelines - laying the foundation for other animators to come on board and be up and running quickly. When the Animation team starts to grow, in addition to animation I\'ll also be handling critiques, scoping, scheduling, managing outsourcing, inter-departmental communications, and anything else animation-related.',

But lately, I’m trying to embrace my inner RP’er so I might switch it up for the launch of the game and create something a little more immersive. The history of McFly just comes from my love of the Back to the Future movies.',

        fieldContent: 'It was early morning and a heavy fog sat in a quiet wood. Dense as a cloud, the fog meandered through thickets and over footpaths like the frayed ends of a white and billowy dress. And like a cloud the fog was not idle, but moved as one tall and gentle stream. To pass through it would wet your skin and the flora of the wood was pregnant with dew.',
